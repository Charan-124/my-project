Experiment-3

Admin Dashboard with grid display and theme switch using HTML and CSS 

in this experiment I have created an Admin Dashboard using grid display and checkbox for theme switching with CSS and HTML

key features:
1) :root
:root is a special CSS selector that targets the very element of the HTML.

In our CSS, it’s used to define CSS custom properties (variables) for colors like --header-bg-color, --main-bg-color, etc
This creates a reusable value that can be applied anywhere in your styles using variables

2) input:checked ~ .container 
This is a CSS sibling selector combined with a state selector:

input:checked targets the <input> when it’s checked (like a checkbox or radio button).

~ .container selects the .container element that comes after the input in the HTML structure.

In your CSS, when the hidden checkbox with ID theme is checked, it updates the variables to dark theme values.

This creates a pure CSS theme toggle without JavaScript.

3) grid-template-columns defines two columns:

First column = fixed 150px 
Second column = automatically adjust rest area 

4) grid-template-rows defines three rows:

Row 1 = 70px (header)
Row 2 = auto (content area)
Row 3 = 60px (footer)

Learning Outcomes:

1 Understand and Use CSS Variables
2 Apply the :root Selector Effectively
3 Implement Theme Switching Using Pure CSS
4 use of grid display
